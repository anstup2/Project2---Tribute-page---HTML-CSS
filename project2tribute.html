    </h2>
    <form>
    <div id="tribute-info">
      <p id="info"><strong>1955</strong> - Piers was born on 11 April 1955 in Crowborough, Sussex, UK.
      </p>
      <p id="info"><strong>1973</strong> - He graduated Cranbrook School, where he trained as a Royal Air Force cadet to pilot gliders and powered aircraft.  He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh and a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds.
      </p>
      <p id="info"><strong>1982</strong> - Piers moved with his wife to the United States, where he began his NASA career as a research meteorologist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. focused primarily on computer modelling of climate systems, but he maintained his aircraft pilot skills.

      <h3>NASA EXPERIENCE:  
      </h3>
      <p id="info"><strong>1996</strong> - Sellers was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April. He reported to the NASA Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation and was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch, followed by service in the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch.
      </p>
      <h4>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:
      </h4>
      <p id="info"><strong>STS-112 Atlantis (October 7-18, 2002)</strong> was an International Space Station assembly mission during which the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-5 in delivering and installing the S-One Truss (the third piece of the station's 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure).  To outfit and activate the new component Sellers performed three spacewalks and logged a total of 19 hours and 41 minutes of EVA. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers.  The mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.
    </p>
      <p id="info"><strong>STS-121 (July 4-17, 2006)</strong> was a return-to-flight test mission and assembly flight to the International Space Station.  During the 13-day flight the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery tested new equipment and procedures that increase the safety of space shuttles, and produced never-before-seen, high-resolution images of the Shuttle during and after its July 4th launch.  The crew also performed maintenance on the space station and delivered and transferred more than 28,000 pounds of supplies and equipment, and a new Expedition 13 crew member to the station.  Piers Sellers and Mike Fossum performed 3 EVAs to test the 50-ft robotic arm boom extension as a work platform.  They removed and replaced a cable that provides power, command and data and video connections to the station’s mobile transporter rail car.  They also tested techniques for inspecting and repairing the reinforced carbon-carbon segments that protect the shuttle’s nose cone and leading edge of the wings.  The STS-121 mission was accomplished in 306 hours, 37 minutes and 54 seconds.
      </p>
      <p id="info"><strong>STS-132 Space Shuttle Atlantis (14–26 May 2010)</strong> was an International Space Station assembly mission. The primary payload was the Russian Rassvet Mini-Research Module along with an Integrated Cargo Carrier-Vertical Light Deployable (ICC-VLD). This was the final scheduled mission of Atlantis. Sellers took a four-inch wood sample of Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree, a piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired Newton's theory of gravity, along with a picture of Newton. The wood is part of the collection of the Royal Society archives in London, and was returned after the flight. He also took an original watercolor portrait of Cranbrook School painted by Brenda Barratt.

      <p id="mention">Piers Sellers was passioned about all aspects of exploration. He contributed through his work until his last moments to the climate research science and spoke with eloquence about our Earth fragility. He featured in the global warming documentary "Before the Flood" by Leonardo DiCaprio. He was brave, dedicated, and an contagious optimist who trusted that the human kind can revert in this last 24h the faith of our planet especially through good strong political measures and through each one of us contribution. Even if today NASA is using satellite imaging and its researchers are working with computer modelling to extract patterns of the extreme weather events, their intensity and location can no longer be predicted with accuracy, due to climate change.

      <p id="message">"We all live on an unbelievable beautiful planet. Earth, and the life on Earth have evolved to fit each other perfectly. Now I am also a climate scientist and I have spent most of my life to try to better understand how the life system works. And the Science community with whom I work with is convinced that we humans are changing the planet and the climate in a potential dezastrous way. To make the changes we need to make and to reach a safer future we all need the resources of everybody here: the Scientists, the Policy Makers and Industrialists - all working together towards a common goal. And that goal is a Planet that can continue to support Life, including all of us. Thank you."
